# SWTOR GUI Parser
#### A parser for the SWTOR GUI Profile XML files written in Python

This class was originally written for the [GSF Parser](https://github.com/RedFantom/GSF-Parser), but I have provided it
here so it can be found better by using search machines for those who are looking to parse the SWTOR GUI profile files.
The class is fully written in Python, so if you would like to use it in combination with another programming language,
either bindings are required or a complete rewrite into another programming language. Documentation is provided in the
form of docstrings. If anything is unclear, feel free to contact me at the e-mail address listed in my 
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/RedFantom)
